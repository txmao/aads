All source codes are in assignment4/src folder
  - mygraph.java, source code for mygraph class, containing graph initialization, DFS traversal, and BFS traversal;
  - test.java, source code for testing;
  
In the folder assignment4:
  - run.sh, the script for running the test in command line;
  - graphs_for_test.pdf, shows the graphical view of the 3 graphs (undirected connected, undirected unconnected, directed) in test.java;
  - Screenshot.png, shows the execution result of the test;
  
How to compile & run (in command line, for example)
  - cd to the assignment4 folder
  - type sh run.sh
  note: make sure you install Java before running the test!

# requirements #
Graph algorithms.
1. You will use incident matrix to represent a graph.  Use at least 10 vertices and 15 edges in the graph. You may hard code the graph.
a. Write a program to do DFS traversal on the graph.  Use two types of graphs - connected and not connected.  Then run the same algorithm on a directed graph.
b. Write a program to do BFS traversal on the graph. Again use undirected connected and not connected graph and then also run on a directed graph.
Your submission will consist of code.
          execution output of the two algorithms ... run them 3 times each (undirected connected, undirected unconnected and directed.)
