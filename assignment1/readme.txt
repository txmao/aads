Source codes are in assigment1/src folder

slnode.java and sllist.java are the source code for problem 1;
bsearch.java is the source code for problem 2;
test.java is the test for both codes in problem 1 and problem 2;

To compile and execute the program:
1. you can just import the project in eclipse, and run the test
2. or you can go to the assigment1/src, (for example in linux)
   compile all .java file using javac *.java,
   and run java test





#### requirements ####
1. Implement selection sort on a single linked list. 

   a. Create  a single  linked list of 10 numbers in random order.

   b. Traverse the list and show the node values.

   c. Sort the linked list.  Sort it so that you exchange the nodes and not just the values.

   d. Traverse the list again to show the values in sorted order.

2. Write a recursive algorithm to do binary search in a sorted array.

    a. Create an array of 15 sorted numbers.  You may hard code the values in the main function.

    b. Implement the recursive binary search.

    c. run the program to search for a number in the list

    d. run the program to search for a number not in the list.

    e. Create an array of 16 numbers and repeat steps a-d


Submit the code for each of the above.

submit screen shots showing all executions.

Submit instructions about compile and execution in a readme.txt file
